That's why family is so important to me, why I cherish it so much. My family is not big. I have a mom, dad and older brother. I love my mother very much. Wherever I am, whatever happens to me, I always count on her support and help. She always pays a lot of attention to my brother and me, she always listens and advises. You can talk about everything with her, and this is very important. It’s good when there is such a person from whom you don’t need to hide anything. Mom works at a factory as an engineer. She is a good and competent specialist, she is appreciated at work. My family is very friendly. We discuss all problems together and help each other in something.Every member of my family is my best friend. My family means a lot to me. It's not just two, three or seven people who live </p>

It's not just two, three or seven people who live together. This group of people who support each other in different situations. Anything can happen in this life, but I know that the only people who will always love and understand me are my family. The people who will always love and understand me are my family.I have a very good, kind and cheerful family in which there is mutual understanding, and, most importantly, a manifestation of kindness and care. And in my opinion, each member should contribute to the happiness of the family. After all, having a good family in our time is a gift of fate. You need to appreciate what you have, because it is easier to lose than to find again. </p>
